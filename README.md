# BANK-CUSTOMER-CHURN-MODEL

This repository contains a bank customer churn model developed using machine learning techniques. The aim of this model is to predict which customers are likely to churn or close their accounts with the bank. By identifying potential churners in advance, the bank can take proactive measures to retain these customers and mitigate revenue loss.

DATA :
The model is built on historical customer data, including demographic information, account details, transaction history, customer interactions, and other relevant variables. This data serves as the input for the machine learning algorithms.

Note : 
This README file provides a brief overview of the Bank Customer Churn Model and its components. For detailed implementation instructions and code, please refer to the relevant files in the repository.

Hope you find it useful!!!
